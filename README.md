# NLP Sentiment & Fine-Tuning Projects

This repo includes two natural language processing projects focused on understanding and applying NLP techniques with fine-tuning transformer models.

## üìù Projects

### 1. Sentiment Analysis
A hands-on project using traditional NLP methods for classifying sentiment from text data.

**Key highlights:**
- Text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, etc.)
- Feature extraction with TF-IDF
- Logistic regression and evaluation metrics

### 2. Transformer Fine-Tuning
Fine-tuning a pretrained transformer model (e.g., BERT) for a downstream text classification task.

**Key highlights:**
- Dataset loading and formatting
- Model training with Hugging Face Transformers
- Validation and performance tracking

## üöÄ Tech Stack
- Python
- scikit-learn
- Hugging Face Transformers
- PyTorch
- pandas / NumPy
- Jupyter Notebook
