# NLP Sentiment & Fine-Tuning Projects

This repo contains two distinct workflows for sentiment classification:
1. A traditional machine learning pipeline using TF-IDF + Logistic Regression.
2. A transformer-based fine-tuning pipeline using Hugging Face + BERT.

Both are applied to real sentiment data and include full preprocessing, training, evaluation and insight generation.

## Project Goals

By examining both pipelines, the repo helps understand the trade-offs between model complexity and interpretability, practical steps for real-world NLP and how transformer fine-tuning differs from classical vectorization.
