# NLP Sentiment & Fine-Tuning Projects

This repo includes two natural language processing projects focused on understanding and applying NLP techniques and model training with Hugging Face Transformers.

## Projects

### 1. Sentiment Analysis
A hands-on project using traditional NLP methods for classifying sentiment from text data.

**Key highlights:**
- Text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal).
- Feature extraction with TF-IDF.
- Logistic regression and evaluation metrics.

### 2. Transformer Fine-Tuning
Fine-tuning a pretrained transformer model (BERT) for a downstream text classification task.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- scikit-learn
- Hugging Face Transformers
- PyTorch
