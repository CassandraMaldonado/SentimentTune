# NLP Sentiment & Fine-Tuning Projects

This repo contains two distinct workflows for sentiment classification:
1. A traditional machine learning pipeline using TF-IDF + Logistic Regression.
2. A transformer-based fine-tuning pipeline using Hugging Face + BERT.

Both are applied to real sentiment data and include full preprocessing, training, evaluation and insight generation.

## 🧪 Project Goals

This project demonstrates and compares:
- ✅ A **lightweight, interpretable baseline** for text classification using scikit-learn.
- 🤗 A **modern transformer-based approach** with minimal manual feature engineering and strong performance.

By examining both pipelines, the repo helps students, analysts, and engineers understand:
- trade-offs between model complexity and interpretability,
- practical steps for real-world NLP,
- how transformer fine-tuning differs from classical vectorization.
